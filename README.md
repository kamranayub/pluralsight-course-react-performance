## About the Course

> Slow React app with unhappy users? This course will teach you how to quickly audit, diagnose, and solve common performance issues in React applications so you can design them more efficiently and ultimately deliver an optimized real-user experience.

Complex React applications have a lot of moving parts that can grind to a halt, causing a poor user experience. In this course, React Performance Playbook, youâ€™ll learn to audit, diagnose, solve, and prevent React web performance problems. 

First, youâ€™ll explore how performance drives business value and how to get buy-in with your team. 

Next, you'll learn to design and perform a performance audit to identify issues. 

Then, youâ€™ll see how to optimize common component performance problems that reduce unnecessary re-renders. 

Finally, youâ€™ll learn how to optimize your appâ€™s loading time and deliver an improved real-user experience. 

When youâ€™re finished with this course, youâ€™ll have the skills and knowledge of React performance needed to make your app snappy and your users happy.
